# Focus-level-of-students-in-online-learning
A Machine learning  model for measuring and analyzing students' concentration levels in online learning.

# Description
This machine learning model aims to improve the learning process in online learning by observing the movements
and facial expression of the learner or student through the camera. Then it analyzes the level of concentration
or focus, whether he/she is bored, frustrated or engaged, and notifies the teacher accordingly. Correspondingly, 
the teacher can take action to engage the learner in the learning process.

It consists three Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) Jupiter notebooks .
1. data_setp.ipynb : To set the environment and prepare the dataset for further training and testing. 
2. base_model.ipynb : It is the base form  scratch model without any regulation technique.
2. model_dataAug.ipynb . A second model with data Augmention regulation technique.

# Try it yourself
If you want to train and test the model yourself, you should do the following steps.
- Open it on Google Colab 
- First open and run data_setp.ipynb . 
- Then open run base_model.ipynb
- Finally open and run model_dataAug.ipynb.
