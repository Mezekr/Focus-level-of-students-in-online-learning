# Focus-level-of-students-in-online-learning
A Machine learning  model for measuring and analyzing students' concentration levels in online learning.

# Description
It consists of three Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) Jupiter notebooks .
1. data_setp.ipynb , to set the environment for further training and testing. 
2. base_model.ipynb . it is the base form  scratch model without any regulation technique.
2. model_dataAug.ipynb . A second model with data extension regulation technique .

Try it yourself
If you want to train and test the model yourself, you should do the following steps.
- Open it on Google Colab 
- First download and run data_setp.ipynb . 
- then run base_model.ipynb
- Finally run model_dataAug.ipynb.
